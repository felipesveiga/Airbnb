A Data Analysis regarding Airbnb operations in Boston

This project aims to explore informations about a data set regarding Boston's Airbnb registered dwellings.

I've challenged myself to perform the following tasks:
<p style = 'font-size:20px;margin-left:50px'> 1 - Get the dwelling type composition per neighborhood.</p>
<p style = 'font-size:20px;margin-left:50px'> 2 -  Compare the average prices among residences with different reputations among their customers. </p>
<p style = 'font-size:20px;margin-left:50px'> 3 - Find out whether Airbnb superhosts take advantadge of their status in order to charge higher prices to their customers. </p>
<p style = 'font-size:20px;margin-left:50px'> 4 - Discover if it is more expensive to stay in Boston's richer neighborhoods.</p>
