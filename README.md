A Data Analysis project regarding Airbnb operations in Boston

This project aims to explore informations about a data set regarding Boston's Airbnb registered dwellings.

I've challenged myself to perform the following tasks:

1 - Get the dwelling type composition per neighborhood.

2 - Compare the average prices among residences with different reputations on the app.

3 - Find out whether Airbnb superhosts take advantadge of their status in order to charge higher prices to their customers.

4 - Discover if it is more expensive to stay in Boston's richer neighborhoods than in other areas of the city.
